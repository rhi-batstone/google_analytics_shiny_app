# CodeClan Aggregate User Data by Location

## Project Brief
### Regional Performance

The client wanted the ability to analyse website performance as Google Analystics is too restrictive.
- Limited or no ability to compare site performance two or three locations in a single view
- Overview of a single city’s performance is complicated because of Google Analytics’ use of multiple small towns around a given city
- We would like to be able to compare high-level site performance in a defined Edinburgh and a Glasgow catchment, and also attach high level targets per catchment, including Inverness

## Tools

The data was pulled from the google_analytics API and then synthesized for demonstration purposes. 

The dashboard was created shinydashboard with the following libraries: 
- library(leaflet)
- library(lubridate)
- library(shiny)
- library(tidyverse)
- library(tsibble)

## Creating synthetic data
In order to demonstrate this dashboard publicly, the data from Google Analytics was synthesised. 
Calls were made to the GoogleAnalytics API to extract the metrics and dimension of interest. The output data was put through the synthpop library in R.

The date range in this public dashboard is limited to a year to match the dates of the synthetic data.


## Dashboard
### Main Page Overview
In an attempt to not overcomplicate the dashboard and ensure we answered the brief the dashboard was limited to one interactive tab. The user can select a desired date range and see the geographical location of the users who have booked an event.

### Debugging Tab
This tab shos the number of session and conversion of events booking depending on the channel used to access the website or type of social network.
